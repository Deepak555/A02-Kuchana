<div class="design"><p>Energy the the capasity or ability to do certain work.Basically energy is both renewable and non renewable.Energy is a property which can be transfered to different objects or converted into different forms.There are two important forms of energy,one is the "Potential energy" and the other the "Kinetic energy".The Potential energy is found in the objects which are at rest i.e, the energy is stored in the object.In case of the Kinetic energy,energy is found in the moving objects like a race car,current etc. </p>

<div class=para2>
The basic unit in which the energy is measured is "Joule",it is the MKS unit of energy.The energy which is stored should be converted into "POWER" for its usage.Power is measured in "Watts",energy in the form of power is measured in Watt hour .The "Horse Power" is another unit in which the power can be measured. 1 HorsePower = 745.7 Watts".Other units of energy are "Calories,British Thermal Unit(BTU)".
